- Initial load and Delta load.

## Notes:
- Dimension modeling, often referred to as the star schema in the data warehousing domain.
- Adheres to the principles of Second Normal Form (2NF) in database design.
- A star schema typically consists of a central fact table surrounded by multiple dimension tables.
